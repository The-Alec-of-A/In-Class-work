## About Me
![alt text](self1.png)

I’ve taken courses at SUNY New Paltz about programming fundamentals, programming data structures, assembly & machine learning language, and game design. These courses altogether covered Java, C, SQL, and Godot to name the ones most used, as well as some HTML. My most significant achievement I think was making a game last semester for the Introduction to Game Design class (CPS293) using Godot, and it is available on Itch.io. It’s something I would very much like to keep adding things to in my free time. I also made a game back in high school using Visual BASIC 2017.

I can imagine the practicality of this class easily in pursuing a career. Learning how to use more programming tools and languages will certainly look good and give me more credibility on my resume for business recruiters seeking people who know how to build professional-looking websites. The exact job I hope to get in the future I’m not completely sure about, but I want there to be programming involved. Designing web pages and working on video games would certainly be a fun choice. Web servers based around using GIS would also not be bad, though I don’t know if that’s more exhilarating than what I suggested in the previous sentence.
